CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

    Quilt Yardage Calculator

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

It will help quilter calculate how much fabric they need to buy based on the 
standard quilt block they will be using (chosen from a selector menu), 
the size of an individual block and the size (width and height) of the quilt.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

How to write a program from scratch, including planning, implementing, testing and error handling;
how to write effective functions; and how to use a GUI for user input and displaying results.

4. What Python modules will your program use?

    csv, math, pytest, and tkinter.

5. List the names of functions you will need?

    main()
    populate_main_window()
    update_gui()
    calculate()
    clear()
    create_dictionary()
    get_block_data()
    compute_yardage()
    validate_int_entry()

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.

    test_create_dictionary()
    test_get_block_data()
    test_compute_yardage()
