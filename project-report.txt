=============Example====================

2024-07-10      2.75    Researched Tkinter and wrote a practise program to try my GUI knowledge.
                        Began project plan. Found out how to create a drop down select menu and have
                        it update the ui upon selection.
2024-07-11      3       Coded a select menu into my practise program. Researched how to include images in
                        the ui and added them to my practise program. Drew up a plan for my program,
                        including GUI sketch. Created png images for my project.
2024-07-12      3.25    Wrote pseudo code for all the functions, wrote the main function, the read_csv function,
                        and typed up the labels, entries and buttons in the populate_main_window function
                        as well as the clear function, etc.
                        Wrote the code for the select menu as well as the images. Wrote the update_ui function.
                        Lots of debugging.
2024-07-13      1.5     Researched how to implement tkinter Entry widgets, watched a video. Wrote the code
                        for the Entry widgets in my project. Began validation code.
2024-07-14      1.5     Researched how to implement the validation correctly. Worked on the validation functions.
2024-07-15      3.75    Wrote the compute_yardage function and created the grid for all the ui elements in the
                        populate_main_window function. Worked on other functions as needed. Debugging.
2024-07-16      3.25    Reworked validation code to make it more responsive, and get error messages to work correctly.
                        Began work on the test program for two functions. Researched "Mocking for unit testing". Rewrote
                        the clear function and updated other functions as needed. Debugging.
2024-07-17      3.75    Finished test program. Had to move a function out of the populate_main_window function and make it
                        a top-level function to be testable, which makes it more modular anyway. Figured out how to allow 
                        update_ui (upon change of selection) to call validate_for_compute, without a KeyRelease event,
                        and maintain the integrity of the validation. Updated other functions as needed, including making
                        the clear function smarter (to work with new update_ui capabilities).
2024-07-18      2       Made some small code refinements, updated documentation, and polished the look of the ui.
